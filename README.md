# Rapido-Ride-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
💡 About the Project:
This Power BI dashboard is based on a real-world dataset from Kaggle (Rapido Rides) — where I performed complete Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Visualization to uncover key business insights that can help improve operational efficiency and customer experience.

⚙️ Tools & Skills Used:

🧩 Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX Measures, KPI Cards, Dashboard Design)

🧹 Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)

📅 DAX (Calendar Table, Time Intelligence Functions)

📈 Data Storytelling & Visualization Techniques

📊 Key KPIs & Insights Uncovered:

🚘 Total Rides: Overall rides completed across different services

✅ Completed Rides & Cancelled Rides: Ride success vs cancellation analysis

⚠️ Cancellation Rate (%): Performance and service reliability metric

💰 Total Revenue (Completed Rides): Key financial indicator

💸 Average Fare, Fare per KM, Median Fare: Pricing and revenue efficiency

📏 Average Distance & Duration: Typical ride length and time

⚡ Average Speed (km/h): Service performance

🕐 Peak Hours (7–11 AM): Maximum demand period

🛵 Top Service Types: Bike > Auto > Cab Economy

💳 Top Payment Methods: GPay, Paytm, Amazon Pay most preferred

🎯 Business Storyline & Findings:

“Most rides occur during morning peak hours (7–11 AM), with ‘Bike’ service contributing the highest ride volume and revenue. GPay and Paytm are the most popular payment methods. The overall cancellation rate remains moderate, but optimizing peak-hour performance can further improve customer satisfaction and revenue.”

🏆 Project Impact:
This dashboard demonstrates how real ride data can be transformed into actionable insights — helping companies like Rapido make data-driven decisions in operations, pricing, and customer engagement.
